# Understanding Place-Based Conversion Factors through Bayesian Spatial Analysis

#### Sheena Yoon, PhD Candidate in Economics, University of Utah  {.unnumbered} 
This dissertation demonstrates how to integrate **Spatial Capabilities Theory** with **Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)** methodology to analyze place-based factors affecting criminal justice outcomes. This dissertation shows how advanced Bayesian spatial methods can translate theoretical insights about capability formation into empirical analysis that translate to evidence-based policy tools.
