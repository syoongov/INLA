# SPATIAL CAPABILITIES AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS: 
## Understanding Place-Based Conversion Factors through Integrated Bayesian Analysis  {.unnumbered} 

This study employs the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) Bayesian methods to analyze the spatial distribution of community punishment across Utah from 2016-2023, examining how systems of punishment intersect with place-based capability deprivations. While traditional studies of community punishment have focused on metropolitan areas, recent evidence suggests that most correctional system involvement now originates from non-metropolitan regions - including small cities, towns, and rural areas, which comprise most of Utah’s geography. Using data from Utah's Department of Corrections, this paper develops a Bayesian hierarchical model grounded in the capabilities approach from feminist economics to examine how the spatial distribution of community punishment relates to social provisioning and institutional capacity. The analysis explores how capability deprivations - including restricted access to healthcare, economic opportunities, public safety resources, transportation, and social services - are structurally embedded in place and shape community-level criminal justice outcomes. The INLA methodology allows for robust estimation of spatial random effects while accounting for the complex neighborhood structure of these capability constraints across Utah's diverse geography. This feminist economic framework, combined with spatial Bayesian modeling, provides critical insights for evidence-based policy-making by identifying how place-based deprivations of capabilities interact with systems of community punishment. The findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in social provisioning plays a crucial role in shaping community corrections outcomes, with important implications for addressing structural inequities through place-based policy interventions across Utah's criminal justice and social provisioning system.
