# Bridging Theory and Method for Criminal Justice Analysis

## Theoretical Framework: Spatial Capabilities Approach
The core conceptual model of this theoretical framework is the capabilities approach which provides a powerful lens for understanding how place-based factors influence criminal justice outcomes. Our theoretical framework integrates the capabilities process with spatial analysis to understand how geographic context shapes the translation of resources into actual opportunities.

### Key Theoretical Components

::: {.callout-note}
## Three Fundamental Elements

**1. Conversion Factors**: The mechanisms that translate resources into actual capabilities
  
  - **Personal**: Skills, health status, trauma history, decision-making capacity
  - **Social**: Community norms, social networks, cultural context, power relations  
  - **Environmental**: Infrastructure, institutions, geographic location, environmental conditions

**2. Capability Sets**: The actual freedoms and opportunities available to individuals

  - **Social Capabilities**: Community integration, cultural connection, civic participation
  - **Economic Capabilities**: Employment access, skill development, financial stability
  - **Health Capabilities**: Treatment access, wellness management, healthcare navigation

**3. Spatial Embedding**: How capabilities develop and cluster geographically
  
  - **Collective capabilities** that emerge through community-level processes
  - **Cross-boundary spillovers** between neighboring communities
  - **Place-based constraints** and opportunities

## Neighborhood Effects and Spatial Processes

```

The neighborhood effects framework illustrates how **residential segregation by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status** creates differential access to capability-enhancing resources. This process operates through:

### Physical Environment Pathways
- **Environmental exposures** (air quality, pollution, hazards)
- **Food and recreational resources** (access to healthy options, safe spaces)
- **Built environment quality** (housing, infrastructure, transportation)
- **Aesthetic quality and natural spaces** (parks, green space, community appearance)

### Social Environment Pathways  
- **Safety and violence** (community safety, exposure to trauma)
- **Social connections and cohesion** (collective efficacy, social capital)
- **Local institutions** (schools, healthcare, community organizations)
- **Culture and norms** (community values, expectations, social control)

### Individual and Behavioral Mediators
The pathway from neighborhood conditions to outcomes operates through **stress and behavioral mediators**, highlighting how environmental conditions get "under the skin" to affect individual functioning and decision-making.

# Methodological Integration: INLA and Capabilities

## Why INLA for Capabilities Analysis?

The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) methodology aligns perfectly with spatial capabilities theory:

## Theoretical Alignment

### Core Alignments

**1. Multiple Conversion Factors**

- INLA handles multiple covariates simultaneously
- Accounts for interaction effects between factors
- Models spatial dependencies and hierarchical relationships
- Captures the complex interplay of personal, social, and environmental factors

**2. Spatial Embedding of Capabilities**

- Models neighborhood effects as collective capabilities
- Accounts for spatial clustering of opportunities and constraints
- Captures spillover impacts between communities
- Reflects how capabilities develop collectively within geographic space

**3. Uncertainty Recognition**

- Provides full posterior distributions rather than point estimates
- Offers credible intervals essential for policy risk assessment
- Quantifies uncertainty in capability measurements
- Supports evidence-based decision making under uncertainty

## Model Specification

### Mathematical Framework

The INLA-BYM2 model operationalizes spatial capabilities theory:

$$y_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i)$$

$$\log(\mu_i) = \log(E_i) + \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j x_{ij} + u_i + v_i$$

### Components Map to Capabilities Theory

- **$y_i$**: Observed correctional population count in census tract $i$ (functioning outcome)
- **$E_i$**: Expected count controlling for population size (standardization)
- **$X_{ij}$**: Capability measures and conversion factors
- **$u_i$**: Structured spatial random effect (**collective capabilities**)
- **$v_i$**: Unstructured random effect (individual variation)
- **$\beta_j$**: Fixed effects measuring individual conversion factor impacts

### Spatial Random Effects Decomposition

$$u_i = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\tau_u}}\left(\sqrt{\phi} \cdot z_i + \sqrt{1-\phi} \cdot \epsilon_i\right)$$

Where:

- **$\phi$**: Mixing parameter measuring importance of spatial clustering vs. individual factors
- **$z_i$**: Spatially structured component (collective capabilities)
- **$\epsilon_i$**: Unstructured component (individual variation)

## Policy Translation

### From Spatial Analysis to Intervention Design

**Collective Capabilities ($u_i$)**:

- Identify capability clusters across geographic space
- Map resource distribution and service accessibility  
- Locate gaps in community infrastructure
- Target place-based interventions

**Conversion Factors ($\phi$)**:

- Assess how strongly place matters for outcomes
- Evaluate barriers to capability development
- Guide geographic targeting of resources
- Plan coordination between neighboring areas

**Individual Effects ($\beta_j$)**:

- Measure direct impacts of specific conversion factors
- Identify which capabilities matter most
- Prioritize intervention components
- Design individual-level support services

Recent advances in Bayesian spatial modeling [@rue2009approximate; @riebler2016intuitive; @simpson2017penalising] have made complex spatial analysis more accessible.
