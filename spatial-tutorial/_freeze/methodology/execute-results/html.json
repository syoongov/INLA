Our theoretical framework integrates the capabilities process with spatial analysis to understand how geographic context shapes the translation of resources into actual opportunities.\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph SE[\"Spatial Environment\"]\n        direction TB\n        PI[\"Physical Infrastructure\"] -->|shapes| CF[\"Conversion Factors\"]\n        II[\"Institutional Infrastructure\"] -->|enables| CF\n        SI[\"Social Infrastructure\"] -->|supports| CF\n    end\n\n    subgraph CP[\"Capability Process\"]\n        direction LR\n        R[\"Resources\"] -->|converted by| CF\n        CF -->|enable| CAP[\"Capabilities\"]\n        CAP -->|achieve| F[\"Functionings\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph CO[\"Community Outcomes\"]\n        direction TB\n        F -->|influences| CR[\"Crime Reduction\"]\n        F -->|supports| CI[\"Community Integration\"]\n        F -->|enables| SS[\"Supervision Success\"]\n    end\n\n    style SE fill:#f0f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    style CP fill:#fff0f3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    style CO fill:#f0fff4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n```\n\n### Key Theoretical Components\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Three Fundamental Elements\n\n**1. Conversion Factors**: The mechanisms that translate resources into actual capabilities\n  \n  - **Personal**: Skills, health status, trauma history, decision-making capacity\n  - **Social**: Community norms, social networks, cultural context, power relations  \n  - **Environmental**: Infrastructure, institutions, geographic location, environmental conditions\n\n**2. Capability Sets**: The actual freedoms and opportunities available to individuals\n\n  - **Social Capabilities**: Community integration, cultural connection, civic participation\n  - **Economic Capabilities**: Employment access, skill development, financial stability\n  - **Health Capabilities**: Treatment access, wellness management, healthcare navigation\n\n**3. Spatial Embedding**: How capabilities develop and cluster geographically\n  \n  - **Collective capabilities** that emerge through community-level processes\n  - **Cross-boundary spillovers** between neighboring communities\n  - **Place-based constraints** and opportunities\n:::\n\n\n## Neighborhood Effects and Spatial Processes\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 2: Neighborhood Effects Framework - How Place Shapes Capabilities](figures/neighborhood_effects.png){fig-align='center' width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe neighborhood effects framework illustrates how **residential segregation by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status** creates differential access to capability-enhancing resources. This process operates through:\n\n### Physical Environment Pathways\n- **Environmental exposures** (air quality, pollution, hazards)\n- **Food and recreational resources** (access to healthy options, safe spaces)\n- **Built environment quality** (housing, infrastructure, transportation)\n- **Aesthetic quality and natural spaces** (parks, green space, community appearance)\n\n### Social Environment Pathways  \n- **Safety and violence** (community safety, exposure to trauma)\n- **Social connections and cohesion** (collective efficacy, social capital)\n- **Local institutions** (schools, healthcare, community organizations)\n- **Culture and norms** (community values, expectations, social control)\n\n### Individual and Behavioral Mediators\nThe pathway from neighborhood conditions to outcomes operates through **stress and behavioral mediators**, highlighting how environmental conditions get \"under the skin\" to affect individual functioning and decision-making.\n\n---\n\n# Methodological Integration: INLA and Capabilities\n\n## Why INLA for Capabilities Analysis?\n\nThe Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) methodology aligns perfectly with spatial capabilities theory:\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Theoretical Alignment\n\n### Core Alignments\n\n**1. Multiple Conversion Factors**\n\n- INLA handles multiple covariates simultaneously\n- Accounts for interaction effects between factors\n- Models spatial dependencies and hierarchical relationships\n- Captures the complex interplay of personal, social, and environmental factors\n\n**2. Spatial Embedding of Capabilities**\n\n- Models neighborhood effects as collective capabilities\n- Accounts for spatial clustering of opportunities and constraints\n- Captures spillover impacts between communities\n- Reflects how capabilities develop collectively within geographic space\n\n**3. Uncertainty Recognition**\n\n- Provides full posterior distributions rather than point estimates\n- Offers credible intervals essential for policy risk assessment\n- Quantifies uncertainty in capability measurements\n- Supports evidence-based decision making under uncertainty\n\n## Model Specification\n\n### Mathematical Framework\n\nThe INLA-BYM2 model operationalizes spatial capabilities theory:\n\n$$y_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_i)$$\n\n$$\\log(\\mu_i) = \\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j x_{ij} + u_i + v_i$$\n\n### Components Map to Capabilities Theory\n\n- **$y_i$**: Observed correctional population count in census tract $i$ (functioning outcome)\n- **$E_i$**: Expected count controlling for population size (standardization)\n- **$X_{ij}$**: Capability measures and conversion factors\n- **$u_i$**: Structured spatial random effect (**collective capabilities**)\n- **$v_i$**: Unstructured random effect (individual variation)\n- **$\\beta_j$**: Fixed effects measuring individual conversion factor impacts\n\n### Spatial Random Effects Decomposition\n\n$$u_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\tau_u}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\phi} \\cdot z_i + \\sqrt{1-\\phi} \\cdot \\epsilon_i\\right)$$\n\nWhere:\n\n- **$\\phi$**: Mixing parameter measuring importance of spatial clustering vs. individual factors\n- **$z_i$**: Spatially structured component (collective capabilities)\n- **$\\epsilon_i$**: Unstructured component (individual variation)\n\n## Policy Translation\n\n### From Spatial Analysis to Intervention Design\n\n**Collective Capabilities ($u_i$)**:\n\n- Identify capability clusters across geographic space\n- Map resource distribution and service accessibility  \n- Locate gaps in community infrastructure\n- Target place-based interventions\n\n**Conversion Factors ($\\phi$)**:\n\n- Assess how strongly place matters for outcomes\n- Evaluate barriers to capability development\n- Guide geographic targeting of resources\n- Plan coordination between neighboring areas\n\n**Individual Effects ($\\beta_j$)**:\n\n- Measure direct impacts of specific conversion factors\n- Identify which capabilities matter most\n- Prioritize intervention components\n- Design individual-level support services\n\n:::\n\n\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 1: Theoretical Framework - From FARS Assessment to Spatial Capabilities](figures/Mermaid_Capabilities_Figure3.png){fig-align='center' width=100% height=auto}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRecent advances in Bayesian spatial modeling [@rue2009approximate; @riebler2016intuitive; @simpson2017penalising] have made complex spatial analysis more accessible.\n\n\n",
