This process operates through:\n\n\n\nEnvironmental exposures (air quality, pollution, hazards)\n\nFood and recreational resources (access to healthy options, safe spaces)\n\nBuilt environment quality (housing, infrastructure, transportation)\n\nAesthetic quality and natural spaces (parks, green space, community appearance)\n\n\n\nSafety and violence (community safety, exposure to trauma)\n\nSocial connections and cohesion (collective efficacy, social capital)\n\nLocal institutions (schools, healthcare, community organizations)\n\nCulture and norms (community values, expectations, social control)\n\nThe pathway from neighborhood conditions to outcomes operates through stress and behavioral mediators, highlighting how environmental conditions get “under the skin” to affect individual functioning and decision-making."

    "text": "This study employs the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) Bayesian methods to analyze the spatial distribution of community punishment across Utah from 2016-2023, examining how systems of punishment intersect with place-based capability deprivations. While traditional studies of community punishment have focused on metropolitan areas, recent evidence suggests that most correctional system involvement now originates from non-metropolitan regions - including small cities, towns, and rural areas, which comprise most of Utah’s geography. Using data from Utah’s Department of Corrections, this paper develops a Bayesian hierarchical model grounded in the capabilities approach from feminist economics to examine how the spatial distribution of community punishment relates to social provisioning and institutional capacity. The analysis explores how capability deprivations - including restricted access to healthcare, economic opportunities, public safety resources, transportation, and social services - are structurally embedded in place and shape community-level criminal justice outcomes. The INLA methodology allows for robust estimation of spatial random effects while accounting for the complex neighborhood structure of these capability constraints across Utah’s diverse geography. This feminist economic framework, combined with spatial Bayesian modeling, provides critical insights for evidence-based policy-making by identifying how place-based deprivations of capabilities interact with systems of community punishment. The findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in social provisioning plays a crucial role in shaping community corrections outcomes, with important implications for addressing structural inequities through place-based policy interventions across Utah’s criminal justice and social provisioning system."

We’ll walk through the key steps from geocoding through final dataset creation.\n\n\n\n# Based on your 01-Batch GEOCODE.R and 02-GeoDaCenter-Health.R scripts\n# Load the final processed spatial dataset\n\n# Import your final dataset (after all geocoding and merging steps)\ncat(\"Loading final spatial dataset...\\n\")\nudc_data &lt;- st_read(\"data/udc_census_full2.shp\", quiet = TRUE)\n\n# Check data structure\ncat(\"Dataset dimensions:\", nrow(udc_data), \"tracts,\", ncol(udc_data), \"variables\\n\")\ncat(\"Missing values check:\\n\")\nprint(colSums(is.na(udc_data)))\n\n\n2.2.1 3.2.1 Address Validation and Standardization\nWhat This Section Accomplishes: This step transforms raw administrative address data into a clean, standardized format suitable for geocoding. The process removes invalid addresses, standardizes formatting, and eliminates duplicates to improve geocoding accuracy and efficiency. Starting with 86,734 original records, this validation process retains 47,529 usable residential addresses (54.8% retention rate), ensuring only legitimate residential locations are included in the analysis.\nFollowing established protocols for administrative address data, the address cleaning process involved multiple validation steps:\n\n2.2.2 3.2.2 Geocoding Methodology\nWhat This Section Accomplishes: This section converts cleaned street addresses into precise geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) using automated geocoding services. The batch processing approach handles large datasets efficiently while maintaining quality control. The process successfully geocodes 44,650 addresses with an 89.7% success rate, providing the spatial foundation needed for census tract assignment and subsequent spatial analysis.\nThe geocoding process employed a batch processing approach to handle the large address dataset efficiently while maintaining spatial accuracy standards.\n\n2.2.3 3.2.3 Spatial Assignment and Validation\nWhat This Section Accomplishes: This step assigns each geocoded address to its corresponding census tract using spatial intersection analysis. The process validates that all coordinates fall within Utah boundaries and ensures accurate geographic assignment. This spatial join creates the link between individual correctional supervision records and neighborhood-level characteristics, enabling tract-level aggregation for subsequent analysis."

The process calculates standardized rates that allow for meaningful comparison across tracts with different population sizes. Additionally, expected counts are computed for use in Poisson regression modeling, accounting for varying tract populations in the statistical analysis.\n\n2.3.2 3.3.2 Explanatory Variable Integration\nWhat This Section Accomplishes: This step assembles predictor variables from multiple data sources representing different theoretical domains of the capabilities framework. Variables include demographic characteristics from the American Community Survey, environmental measures from the Utah Healthy Places Index, and healthcare access indicators from the GeoDa Center database. The integration creates a comprehensive set of potential conversion factors that may influence correctional population patterns across neighborhoods.\n\n2.3.3 3.3.3 Final Dataset Construction\nWhat This Section Accomplishes: This section merges all data sources into a single analysis-ready dataset and creates standardized versions of key variables for modeling. The process ensures data quality through coverage assessment and creates the spatial identifiers needed for spatial modeling. The result is a comprehensive dataset with 98.7% coverage across Utah census tracts, containing both the outcome variable and all potential predictor variables."

    "text": "The contemporary criminal justice landscape presents a fundamental challenge that traditional approaches have failed to address effectively. With nearly 5.5 million adults under correctional control nationally—including 3.7 million under community supervision—the United States has created what can only be described as a system of “mass corrections.” In Utah specifically, this translates to 16,300 adults under community supervision compared to only 5,900 in state prisons, representing a nearly 3:1 ratio that has grown substantially in recent years.\nThis empirical reality demands a theoretical framework that moves beyond individual-focused explanations to understand how place-based factors shape criminal justice outcomes. As Keels (2020) observes, “American society tends to pour money and resources into punishment when victims become perpetrators, even though aggression, substance abuse, and other symptoms targeted as problematic behaviors by the legal system are often coping strategies to increase safety and security in individuals with histories of trauma.” This insight points toward the need for an approach that understands correctional involvement not as individual failure, but as a manifestation of broader capability deprivations embedded in geographic space.\nThe complexity of this challenge becomes apparent when we consider the population characteristics of those under correctional supervision. Research by Western (2015) reveals the concept of “human frailty” among justice-involved populations: 67% have mental illness or addiction histories, 40% witnessed violence before age 18, and 40% experienced family custody loss. These multiple, interacting challenges suggest that effective interventions must address not just individual deficits, but the place-based conversion factors that determine whether available resources translate into actual capabilities for successful community integration."

    "text": "2.1 From Resources to Capabilities: A Fundamental Distinction\nTraditional criminal justice policy operates on an implicit assumption that providing resources—whether treatment programs, job training, or housing assistance—will directly translate into improved outcomes. This resource-focused approach, however, ignores the crucial insight from capabilities theory (Sen 1999; Nussbaum 2000): resources ≠ opportunities. The translation from resources to actual capabilities depends fundamentally on conversion factors that operate at multiple scales and are deeply embedded in geographic space.\nConsider the difference between having a substance abuse treatment program located in a community (a resource) versus individuals actually being able to access, engage with, and benefit from that program (a capability). The conversion from resource to capability depends on transportation accessibility, cultural appropriateness of services, community stigma, family support systems, and numerous other factors that cluster spatially and interact in complex ways.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Theoretical Framework - From FARS Assessment to Spatial Capabilities\n\n\n\nThis comprehensive framework illustrates how individual assessment domains from the Functional Assessment Rating Scale (FARS) connect to broader capability formation processes. The FARS domains—ranging from biological factors like depression and medical conditions, to psychological factors like anxiety and traumatic stress, to social factors like work/school functioning and legal status—represent the observable manifestations of underlying capability processes."

Skills and abilities develop through educational opportunities that vary dramatically by neighborhood. Health status reflects both individual choices and environmental exposures—from air quality to food access to healthcare availability. Trauma history accumulates through exposure to community violence, family instability, and institutional failures that cluster geographically. Even decision-making capacity develops through socialization processes embedded in local cultural contexts.\nSocial Conversion Factors emerge through community-level processes that cannot be reduced to individual characteristics. Community attitudes toward criminal justice involvement shape whether returning citizens face acceptance or rejection. Social networks provide information about employment opportunities, housing options, and service availability—but these networks are geographically bounded and reflect local resource availability. Cultural context determines whether seeking help is viewed as appropriate or stigmatized. Power relations embedded in local political and economic structures determine whose voices are heard in policy decisions affecting community safety and support.\nEnvironmental Conversion Factors represent the most clearly spatial dimensions of capability formation. Infrastructure quality—from transportation systems to broadband access—determines whether individuals can access opportunities located elsewhere. Institutional capacity reflects the accumulated investment in schools, healthcare facilities, community organizations, and government services that has occurred over decades. Geographic location itself matters, as peripheral or isolated communities face inherent barriers to accessing resources concentrated in urban centers. Environmental conditions, from air and water quality to noise and pollution exposure, create differential health impacts that compound over time.\n\n2.2.2 Capability Sets: The Actual Freedoms Available\nThe integration of personal, social, and environmental conversion factors produces capability sets—the actual freedoms and opportunities available to individuals in particular places. These capabilities cluster into domains that map directly onto criminal justice outcomes:\nSocial Capabilities encompass community integration, cultural connection, and civic participation. These capabilities develop through repeated positive interactions within community contexts that either welcome or exclude particular groups. High-capability communities provide multiple pathways for social connection and civic engagement, while low-capability communities may lack the institutional infrastructure necessary to support meaningful participation.\nEconomic Capabilities include employment access, skill development, and financial stability. These capabilities depend not just on individual human capital, but on local labor markets, transportation systems, and the geographic distribution of economic opportunities. Communities with strong economic capabilities provide multiple pathways to financial stability, while economically isolated communities offer few legitimate opportunities for economic advancement.\nHealth Capabilities involve treatment access, wellness management, and healthcare navigation. These capabilities reflect both individual health status and community health infrastructure. High-capability communities provide accessible, culturally appropriate healthcare options and promote community wellness through environmental quality and health-promoting built environments.\n\n2.2.3 Spatial Embedding and Collective Capabilities\nPerhaps most importantly for criminal justice policy, capabilities are not just individually held but develop collectively within geographic communities. Collective capabilities emerge through community-level processes that enhance or constrain individual capability development. These include:\n\n\nInstitutional capacity that determines service availability and quality\n\nSocial cohesion that facilitates information sharing and mutual support\n\nCollective efficacy that enables communities to address shared problems\n\nEnvironmental quality that provides the foundation for healthy development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCore Concept: Conversion Factors\n\n\n\nThe capabilities approach emphasizes that resources ≠ opportunities. The translation from resources to actual capabilities depends on conversion factors that operate at multiple scales:\n\n\nPersonal: Skills, health, trauma history\n\nSocial: Community norms, social networks, institutional capacity\n\n\nEnvironmental: Infrastructure, services, geographic location"

    "text": "2.3 Understanding Neighborhood Effects Through a Capabilities Lens\nThe neighborhood effects framework provides crucial insight into how residential segregation by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status creates systematic inequalities in capability formation. This process operates through multiple, interacting pathways that compound over time and across generations.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Neighborhood Effects Framework - How Place Shapes Capabilities\n\n\n\n\n2.3.1 Physical Environment Pathways: Environmental Conversion Factors\nThe physical environment represents perhaps the most direct manifestation of how place shapes capabilities. Environmental exposures create differential health impacts that accumulate over the life course. Communities experiencing poor air quality—as our Utah analysis reveals with diesel particulate matter—face 494.7% higher correctional supervision rates, suggesting that environmental conditions act as powerful conversion factors constraining multiple capabilities simultaneously.\nFood and recreational resources determine whether communities can support healthy development. Food deserts limit nutritional capability development, while lack of safe recreational spaces constrains physical activity and positive social interaction. The built environment quality—from housing conditions to infrastructure adequacy—provides the basic foundation upon which other capabilities develop.\nAesthetic quality and natural spaces may seem secondary to immediate survival needs, but research consistently demonstrates their importance for mental health, community pride, and social cohesion. Communities with well-maintained parks, tree canopy coverage, and attractive public spaces provide environments that support positive identity formation and community attachment.\n\n2.3.2 Social Environment Pathways: Social Conversion Factors\nThe social environment operates through mechanisms that are less visible but equally powerful in shaping capability formation. Safety and violence exposure creates trauma that affects cognitive development, educational achievement, and social functioning across the life course. Communities with high violence rates constrain mobility, limit social interaction, and create chronic stress that affects decision-making capacity.\nSocial connections and cohesion provide the interpersonal infrastructure necessary for capability development. Strong social networks facilitate information sharing about opportunities, provide emotional support during crises, and create accountability mechanisms that promote positive behavior. Our analysis shows that communities with higher census response rates—a proxy for collective efficacy—have 73.6% lower correctional supervision rates, demonstrating the protective power of social capital.\nLocal institutions serve as the formal infrastructure for capability development. Schools, healthcare facilities, community organizations, and faith-based institutions provide both direct services and spaces for social connection. However, institutional capacity varies dramatically across communities based on historical investment patterns and current resource availability.\nCulture and norms create the informal rules that guide behavior and define what kinds of futures seem possible. Communities with strong norms supporting education, employment, and family stability provide cultural resources that promote capability development, while communities where legitimate opportunities appear unavailable may develop oppositional cultures that can lead to criminal justice involvement.\n\n2.3.3 Individual and Behavioral Mediators: The Pathway “Under the Skin”\nThe pathway from neighborhood conditions to individual outcomes operates through stress and behavioral mediators that represent how environmental conditions get “under the skin” to affect individual functioning. Chronic exposure to environmental stressors—from pollution to violence to economic instability—creates physiological and psychological changes that affect decision-making capacity, emotional regulation, and social functioning.\nThis understanding is crucial for criminal justice policy because it suggests that what appears to be individual criminal behavior often reflects adaptive responses to constraint environments. Rather than viewing criminal behavior as evidence of individual moral failure, a capabilities approach understands it as a symptom of systematic capability deprivation embedded in place-based processes.\n\n2.3.4 Why Spatial Analysis Matters\nTraditional criminal justice research focuses on individual factors, but the capabilities approach suggests that place-based conversion factors may be equally or more important:\n\n\nGeographic clustering of opportunities and constraints\n\nCross-boundary spillovers between neighboring communities\n\nCollective capabilities that emerge through community-level processes\n\nEnvironmental justice concerns affecting capability formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    subgraph SE[\"Spatial Environment\"]\n        direction TB\n        PI[\"Physical Infrastructure\"] --&gt;|shapes| CF[\"Conversion Factors\"]\n        II[\"Institutional Infrastructure\"] --&gt;|enables| CF\n        SI[\"Social Infrastructure\"] --&gt;|supports| CF\n    end\n\n    subgraph CP[\"Capability Process\"]\n        direction LR\n        R[\"Resources\"] --&gt;|converted by| CF\n        CF --&gt;|enable| CAP[\"Capabilities\"]\n        CAP --&gt;|achieve| F[\"Functionings\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph CO[\"Community Outcomes\"]\n        direction TB\n        F --&gt;|influences| CR[\"Crime Reduction\"]\n        F --&gt;|supports| CI[\"Community Integration\"]\n        F --&gt;|enables| SS[\"Supervision Success\"]\n    end\n\n    style SE fill:#f0f8ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    style CP fill:#fff0f3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px\n    style CO fill:#f0fff4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px"

    "text": "The landscape of mass incarceration in the United States has undergone a profound transformation over the past three decades, fundamentally challenging conventional narratives about where and how criminal justice system involvement occurs. Contrary to popular frameworks that position mass incarceration as primarily an urban phenomenon concentrated in racially segregated inner-city neighborhoods, emerging evidence reveals a dramatic spatial redistribution of correctional system involvement toward non-metropolitan regions, including small cities, towns, and rural areas (Kang-Brown & Subramanian, 2017; Simes, 2021). This geographic transformation represents not merely a shift in the location of punishment, but a fundamental restructuring of how systems of social control operate across America’s diverse landscape.\n\n\nRecent research demonstrates that the majority of jail and prison admissions now originate from non-metropolitan regions, with the highest incarceration rates emerging across thousands of smaller cities, towns, and rural areas since the late 1990s (Simes, 2021). This pattern challenges the urban theory of crime that has dominated criminological thinking, which centers on concentrated disadvantage in racially segregated urban neighborhoods characterized by poverty, unemployment, violence, and social disorder. While these urban dynamics remain important, they represent only part of a much larger and more complex geography of punishment that extends into what Simes (2021) terms “America’s forgotten places.”\nThe data reveal striking patterns of this spatial transformation. Rural counties experienced a 436 percent increase in pretrial detention rates between 1970 and 2013, growing from 49 per 100,000 people to 265 per 100,000 people (Kang-Brown et al., 2017). Simultaneously, while urban areas have benefited from criminal justice reforms and public investment in alternative services—mental health programs, diversion initiatives, and community-based interventions—rural regions have received fragmented public investment and have been largely neglected in policy dialogue. The result is an almost universal urban-to-rural shift in prison admissions across the 35 states with reliable county-level data, regardless of whether overall state admissions are declining.\n\n\n\n\nThis geographic transformation has been accompanied by significant demographic changes that further challenge conventional understandings of who experiences criminal justice system involvement. Small counties, including rural areas, have been driving the incarceration of women, with the number of women in jail increasing by 43 percent in rural counties and 29 percent in small and medium metropolitan counties between 2004 and 2014, while declining by 6 percent in urban counties. Similarly, the incarceration of white people grew most dramatically in rural counties—19 percent in rural counties and 15 percent in small and medium metro counties—while declining 15 percent in urban counties.\nThese demographic shifts reflect broader socioeconomic transformations affecting non-metropolitan areas, including the suburbanization of poverty, deindustrialization, disinvestment in social services, the opioid and methamphetamine epidemics, rising rates of “deaths of despair” (Case & Deaton, 2015), untreated mental illness, limited access to public goods, selective out-migration, social isolation, and rising unemployment and underemployment. This constellation of conditions has given rise to what scholars term the “rural ghetto”—areas abandoned by both private capital and public investment that share qualities with urban ghettos due to high levels of segregation and stigmatization.\n\n\n\nEqually significant is the transformation from a system focused primarily on incarceration to one increasingly reliant on community supervision. Currently, 5.5 million adults (1 in 61) are under some form of correctional control, with 3.7 million under community supervision through parole and probation—creating a nearly 2:1 ratio of community supervision to incarceration nationwide. This shift toward “mass corrections” represents a fundamental change in how punishment operates across space, moving beyond the bounded geography of prisons and jails to encompass the communities where individuals live, work, and attempt to rebuild their lives. This transformation has profound implications for understanding punishment as a spatial phenomenon. Unlike incarceration, which concentrates individuals in specific institutional locations, community supervision spreads across the landscape, embedding criminal justice system involvement within the fabric of communities. The effectiveness of community supervision thus depends not only on individual compliance but on the capacity of communities to provide the resources, opportunities, and support systems necessary for successful reintegration. This creates a complex geography of capability and constraint that varies dramatically across different types of places."

    "text": "2.1 Geographic Concentration and Capability Deprivation\nThese patterns suggest that correctional supervision in Utah, as elsewhere, is not randomly distributed across space but concentrates in areas characterized by multiple forms of capability deprivation. This geographic concentration reflects not simply the aggregation of individual disadvantages but the creation of spatial contexts where the conversion factors necessary to translate resources into actual capabilities operate less effectively. Understanding these patterns requires moving beyond individual-focused explanations to examine how place-based factors shape the capacity for human development and successful community integration.\nThe spatial concentration of correctional populations reveals fundamental questions about how systems of punishment interact with patterns of social provisioning, institutional capacity, and community capability. Traditional approaches to criminal justice focus primarily on individual-level interventions—counseling, job training, substance abuse treatment—without adequate attention to the spatial contexts within which these interventions occur. This oversight represents not merely a technical limitation but a fundamental misunderstanding of how human capabilities develop through the complex interaction of individual characteristics, social relationships, and environmental conditions across different places."

Drawing on Robeyns’ capabilities framework from feminist economics, we conceptualize these spatial patterns as evidence of systematic inequalities in the conversion factors that enable individuals and communities to translate available resources into actual capabilities for human flourishing.\nThe analysis will map the geographic distribution of capability deprivations across Utah’s diverse landscape, from urban cores to rural counties, examining how access to healthcare, educational opportunities, economic development, environmental quality, transportation infrastructure, and social services varies across space.

    "text": "This study employs the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) Bayesian methods to analyze the spatial distribution of community punishment across Utah from 2016-2023, examining how systems of punishment intersect with place-based capability deprivations. While traditional studies of community punishment have focused on metropolitan areas, recent evidence suggests that most correctional system involvement now originates from non-metropolitan regions - including small cities, towns, and rural areas, which comprise most of Utah’s geography. Using data from Utah’s Department of Corrections, this paper develops a Bayesian hierarchical model grounded in the capabilities approach from feminist economics to examine how the spatial distribution of community punishment relates to social provisioning and institutional capacity. The analysis explores how capability deprivations - including restricted access to healthcare, economic opportunities, public safety resources, transportation, and social services - are structurally embedded in place and shape community-level criminal justice outcomes. The INLA methodology allows for robust estimation of spatial random effects while accounting for the complex neighborhood structure of these capability constraints across Utah’s diverse geography. This feminist economic framework, combined with spatial Bayesian modeling, provides critical insights for evidence-based policy-making by identifying how place-based deprivations of capabilities interact with systems of community punishment. The findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in social provisioning plays a crucial role in shaping community corrections outcomes, with important implications for addressing structural inequities through place-based policy interventions across Utah’s criminal justice and social provisioning system."
